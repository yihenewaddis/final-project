      <p>This illustration, created at the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention 
        (CDC), reveals ultrastructural morphology exhibited by
         coronaviruses. Note the spikes that adorn the outer surface of
          the virus, which impart the look of a corona surrounding the
           virion, when viewed electron microscopically. A novel 
           coronavirus, named Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome
            coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), was identified as the cause
             of an outbreak of respiratory illness first detected in
              Wuhan, China in 2019. The illness caused by this virus has
               been named coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19).

      <p>This illustration provided a 3D graphic representation of 
        a spherical-shaped, measles virus particle, that was studded 
        with glycoprotein tubercles. Those tubercular studs colorized
         maroon, are known as H-proteins (hemagglutinin), while those
          colorized gray, represented what are referred to as F-proteins
           (fusion). The F-protein is responsible for fusion of the virus
            and host cell membranes, viral penetration, and hemolysis. The H-protein
             is responsible for the binding of virions to cells. Both types of proteinaceous 
        studs are embedded in the particle envelope’s lipid bilayer. </p>
