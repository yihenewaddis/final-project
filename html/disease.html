      <p>Cancer is a disease in which some
         of the body's cells grow uncontrollably

      <h1>Find and Treat
         the Root Cause of Cancer from Precision Cancer Medicine</h1>
         <p>
          Data from the National Cancer Institute have found that there
           were 139,206 new cancer patients in 2021 and 84,073 ones of 
           which died. The top five cancer types that are the most 
           prevalent among Thai people are liver and bile duct cancer,
            breast cancer, lung cancer and colon and rectal cancer as
             well as cervical cancer. Cancer treatment has been vastly
              developed in the present days in terms of both screening 
              technologies and chemotherapy that are designed to reduce 
              the chance of side effects and personalized treatment plan
               for each patient.
          
          Dr. Vigrom Jennetisin, a medical oncologist at Vejthani Hospital, said the most important factor about cancer treatment is finding the cause of the cancer in each patient. The cause can be found by conducting screening test on cancerous cells to determine what mechanism has caused the cells to become cancerous and investigate what is the best medication to inhibit the cancer growth on each patient. The treatment could therefore be more precise and effective. This kind of treatment approach is called Precision Cancer Medicine. This is because a variety
           of mechanisms can result in a growth of cancer in the same organ</p>

      <h1>Cancer Avatar - Precision Cancer Medicine</h1>
         <p>
          Generally, treating cancer with medications requires
           a waiting period to see how the patient responds to the given drugs. If the response is not as expected,
            the type of drugs may need to be changed.

However, currently, an innovative treatment called Cancer Avatar is used to deliver precise and suitable drugs to patients 
from the very beginning of the treatment process.

Dr. Vigrom Jennetisin, a medical oncologist at Vejthani Hospital, explained that treating cancer with Precision Medicine or
 personalized treatment approach is done by gene examinations to find the mutations that occurred in the cancer cells. The 
 examination results will be used as the data for the doctor to determine the drugs that will be most suitable for the mutations. 
 Although Precision Medicine is a personalized treatment, after medications have been given, the patient’s response to those medications
  needs to be constantly monitored for some time. The patient will undergo CT scan, which will detect cancer cells in the body. If the response
   to the treatment is poor or does not meet expectations, the type of drugs that have been used may need to be changed to increase the efficacy of 
   the treatment</p>

  <p>Diabetes is a chronic, metabolic disease characterized by elevated levels of blood glucose 
    (or blood sugar), which leads over time to serious damage to the heart, blood vessels, eyes, kidneys
     and nerves. The most common is type 2 diabetes, usually in adults, which occurs when the body becomes
      resistant to insulin or doesn't make enough insulin. In the past 3 decades the prevalence of type 2 diabetes 
      has risen dramatically in countries of all income levels. Type 1 diabetes, once known as juvenile diabetes or 
      insulin-dependent diabetes, is a chronic condition in which the pancreas produces little or no insulin by itself.
       For people living with diabetes, access to affordable treatment, including insulin, is critical to their survival.
        There is a globally agreed target to halt the rise in diabetes and obesity by 2025.</p>
     <p>About 422 million people worldwide have diabetes, the majority living in low-and middle-income countries, and 1.5 million deaths are directly attributed to diabetes each year. Both the number of cases and the prevalence 
      of diabetes have been steadily increasing over the past few decades.</p>

        <h2>Medications for type 1 diabetes</h2>
        <p>If you have type 1 diabetes, your body can’t make its own insulin. The goal of 
          treatment is to replace the insulin that your pancreas can’t make.
          Diabetes is a condition that leads to high levels of blood glucose (sugar) in the body.

          This reaction happens when your body can’t make or use the 
          hormone insulin like it’s supposed to. Produced by the pancreas,
           insulin helps your body use the sugar from the food you eat.
          
          There are two major types of diabetes: type 1 diabetes and type 2
           diabetes. People with either type need medications to help manage their blood sugar levels.
          
          The types of medications you take will depend on the type of 
          diabetes you have. Learn more about the available treatment

        <h2>Insulin</h1>
        <p>Insulin is the most common type of 
          medication used in type 1 diabetes treatment. There are more than 20 types sold in the United States.

          It’s given as an infusion under the skin (with the help of an
           insulin pump) or as an injection.

       </div>
       <div class="short one">
        <h2>Short-acting insulin:</h2>
        <p>Regular or “short-acting” insulin may reach the bloodstream 30 minutes after injection and peak
           2-3 hours afterward. These injections also work up to 3-6 hours.</p>
       </div>
       <div class="rapid one">
        <h2>Rapid-acting insulin:</h2>
        <p>As the name suggests, rapid-acting insulin works within 15 minutes. The peak time is 1 to
           2 hours after use, and the medication lasts between 2 and 4 hours.</p>
       </div>
       <div class="internal one">
        <h2>Intermediate-acting insulin:</h2>
        <p>Intermediate-acting insulin works about 2-4 hours after use, with an average peak time of 12 hours. 
          You can expect this type of insulin to last between 12 and 18 hours.</p>

        <h2>Medications for type 2 diabetes</h2>
        <p>If you have type 2 diabetes, your body makes insulin
           but no longer uses it well. Your body can’t make enough 
           insulin to keep your blood sugar levels within an optimal
            range.

          The goal of your treatment is to help your body use insulin
           better or to get rid of extra glucose in your blood.
          
          Most medications for type 2 diabetes are oral drugs. However
          , insulin or injectables may also be used. Some of these
           medications are combinations of more than one diabetes

        <p>Some people with type 2 diabetes may also need to take insulin.
           The same types of insulin used to treat type 1 diabetes can also
            treat type 2 diabetes.
            A doctor may recommend the aforementioned types of insulin
             used in type 1 diabetes treatment for type 2 diabetes.
              As with type 1 diabetes, this depends on the type of
               insulin needed and how severe your insulin deficiency
                is. See the above types of insulin to discuss with a

           <h3>1.Don't smoke or use tobacco</h3>
        <p>One of the best things you can do for your heart is to stop smoking or using smokeless tobacco. Even if you're not a smoker, be sure to avoid secondhand smoke.

          Chemicals in tobacco can damage the heart and blood vessels. Cigarette smoke reduces the oxygen in the blood, which increases blood pressure and heart rate because the heart has to work harder to supply enough oxygen to the body and brain.
          
          There's good news though. The risk of heart disease starts to drop in as little as a day after quitting. After a year without cigarettes, the risk of heart disease drops to about half that of a smoker. No matter how long or how much you smoked, you'll start reaping rewards as soon as you quit.</p>

               <p>Regular, daily physical activity can lower the risk of heart disease. Physical activity helps control your weight. It also reduces the chances of developing other conditions that may put a strain on the heart, such as high blood pressure, high cholesterol and type 2 diabetes.

                If you haven't been active for a while, you may need to slowly work your way up to these goals, but in general, you should do aim for at least:

                The body mass index (BMI) uses height and weight to determine whether a person is overweight or obese. A BMI of 25 or higher is considered overweight and is generally associated with higher cholesterol, higher blood pressure, and an increased risk of heart disease and stroke. </p>

                  <h3>5. Get good quality sleep</h3>
               <p>People who don't get enough sleep have a higher risk of obesity, high blood pressure, heart attack, diabetes and depression.

                Most adults need at least seven hours of sleep each night.
                 Make sleep a priority in your life. Set a sleep schedule and
                  stick to it by going to bed and waking up at the same times
                 each day. Keep your bedroom dark and quiet, so it's easier to
                  sleep. </p>
