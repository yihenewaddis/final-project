                                <p>It is a deadly virus with initial symptoms which can include a
                                     sudden fever, intense weakness, muscle pain and a sore throat
                                     Subsequent stages can include vomiting, diarrhoea and - in some cases 
                                        - both internal and external bleeding, known as haemorrhaging
                                        The incubation period can last from two days to three weeks. 
                                            Symptoms of Ebola can sometimes
                                             be confused with other illnesses such as malaria and typhoid.<hr></p>
                                             <h2>Why is this outbreak so serious?</h2>
                                             <p>The virus has been circulating in rural parts of Uganda since
                                                 September but an outbreak in an urban area - like Kampala - 
                                                 is much more complex to deal with.

                                                The population density and ease of mobility, including 
                                                internationally, means the virus can easily travel througha
                                                 infected but asymptomatic patient within a short period of time.</p>
                                                 <p>However an asymptomatic person cannot transmit the virus. Speed is of the essence when tracing contacts of known cases, isolating and monitoring them for at least the 21-day incubation period of the virus.

                                                    The cooperation of such contacts with response teams is also crucial. The infection in Kampala has been traced to a contact of a confirmed case who reportedly travelled to the capital under a disguised identity</p>

                                                            The Health Ministry has said three candidate vaccines from Oxford, Sabin and Merck will be trialled for efficacy "in coming weeks". Several treatment options are also being tested, said Health Minister Jane Ruth Aceng.</p>
